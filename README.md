1.  Authentication:
-   The user signs up and signs in to the app, only by typing their name.
-   The user signs out of to the app

2.  The user is presented with the homepage with the following features:
-   Featured article with full-width image and title in the first row. This should be the article 
    with the number of highest votes.
-   List of all categories in order of priority.

3.  When the user clicks the category name they can see all articles in that category:
-   Articles are sorted by most recent.
-   Each article displays: image, title, truncated text as preview and its author name.
-   A button to add a vote for article (each user can vote only once).

4.  When user opens "New Article" page:
